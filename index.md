## Current Projects

### BLEach
[Repo](https://github.com/danlargo/BLEach)

Clean new approach to BLE wrapper for python

After spending a week starting and then stalling on a python-based scanner for BLE devices (specifically starting from a MAC OS X platform), while also keeping in mind a desire to be platform-independent (targeting Raspian initially), I have decided, as all engineers do, to create another BLE wrapper for python.

This library will aim to support non-ble bluetooth devices down the line but am aiming at simpler BLE devices and BLE sensors using the GATT interface.

Will try to keep moving this forward, I apologize in advance for people that land here hoping to find something that is currently working.

Will be targeting a framework that supports CoreBluetooth on the MAC, with an entirely python based code base (will attempt to build a code base that does not require native code). Will decide on interface support for Raspian later, along with Linux and then Windows support.

Stay tuned, will be a bumpy ride.



### PiZero Security Device
[Repo](https://github.com/danlargo/piSecure)

Pi Zero motion detection system, with python capture and display code, PiZero case, battery and charge circuit.

A "simple" motion capture system for the PiZero platform.
